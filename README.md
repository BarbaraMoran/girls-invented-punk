<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Those of us who were little girls in the 90s and early 2000s had the Spice Girls, Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears as our role models, hypersexualised artists created by an industry for mass consumption. It wasn't common to see a woman playing drums or electric guitar.<br>

I wish we had known earlier Poly Styrene, Viv Albertine, Joan Jett and so many other girls who contributed exceptionally to punk culture.  Kim Gordon, bassist of Sonic Youth, gave a concert wearing a T-shirt that said "Girls invented Punk Rock, not England". In its early days, punk was the culture where a lot of girls were able to develop their creativity. <br>

This website is dedicated to all of them. <br>
